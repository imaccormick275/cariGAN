    "<b>NOTE: </b>Initially I wrote this series of notebooks purely for my own understanding, however I have since adapted them slightly so they can be followed by others. For anyone following them, if they do not run flawlessly for you, I won't be able provide assistance. With some work they should guide you to replicating this algorithm yourself.\n",

    "I remember seeing this project in the news in 2018 when it was published. I was immediately fascinated! This algorithm had managed to extract both the style and form of a work of caricature artist and apply it to an input image. From here my interest expanded to the use of deep learning approaches in art and content creation and what this may mean for the future of the art and design. I have put links to a few of my favourite resources below to get you inspired!\n",

    "The best way to learn is to do! My approach was very much bottom down, I had only been programming for about 1 year when I started this project, and was about halfway through my first tensorflow course. You will not need to be a deep learning wizard to get through this project. However you will have to have knowledge of the basics of tensorflow, and understanding of neural networks, competent with numpy, knowledge of pandas / scikit learn. I would suggest completeing these two courses or similar on machine learning / tensorflow sylabuses| before starting:\n",

To gain better understanding we will dive into each of these terms, researching and obtaining further learning materials where necessary. For many of the key definitions will define simple examples to better aid understanding. Even key terms that may already be familiar, we will look at in context of the cariGAN paper e.g. Principle Component Analysis. This will all be done in a series of notebooks.\n",
